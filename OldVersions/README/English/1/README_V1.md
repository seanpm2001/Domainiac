## Notes

### Original notes

#### 2023 April 20th

Domainiac

Phase 1: gTLDs
Phase 2: ccTLDs and emoji TLDs
Phase 3: All domain names

Utilization of URLL

Database parsing language: Python

I also gained a strong interest in TLDs today after researching the .in (India) domain. I went from there. I am working on planning out a new project based on this interest, currently known as ‚ÄúDomaniac‚Äù (portmanteau of Domain and Maniac) which will be a database of TLDs, gTLDs, ccTLDs, and more. This is the creative ccTLD that helped to inspire the idea:

![/Domainiac/DB/ccTLD/India/dot/‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§/SVG/bharat.svg](/Domainiac/DB/ccTLD/India/dot/‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§/SVG/bharat.svg)

### Continued notes

- Database on all websites using each TLD (just the major parts of the site, not every webpage) in URLL format
