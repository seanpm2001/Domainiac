Domainiac

Phase 1: gTLDs
Phase 2: ccTLDs and emoji TLDs
Phase 3: All domain names

Utilization of URLL

Database parsing language: Python

I also gained a strong interest in TLDs today after researching the .in (India) domain. I went from there. I am working on planning out a new project based on this interest, currently known as ‚ÄúDomaniac‚Äù (portmanteau of Domain and Maniac) which will be a database of TLDs, gTLDs, ccTLDs, and more. This is the creative ccTLD that helped to inspire the idea:

![/Domainiac/DB/ccTLD/India/dot/‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§/SVG/bharat.svg](/Domainiac/DB/ccTLD/India/dot/‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§/SVG/bharat.svg)

- Information on domain name spoofing
- Database on all websites using each TLD (just the major parts of the site, not every webpage) in URLL format
- Domain hacks

The following domains are currently planned to be added next:

- `.cn`
- `.tw`
- `.hk`
- `.mo`
- `.eu`
- `.ru`
- `.gov`
- `.google`
- `.edu`
- `.org`
- `.net`
- `.com`
- `.io`
- `.de`
- `.fr`
- `.uk`
- `.pl`
- `.be`
- `.by`
- `.kr`
- `.es`
- `.us`

This would bring the total to 25+
