> **Note** Sites such as Wikipedia and Yandex are not listed here, as they do not have a `.com` TLD. Wikipedia would have come 7th and Yandex would have come 8th

> **Note** Pornographic sites are listed, but their hyperlinks are replaced with https://www.example.com for legal reasons.

> **Note** Social media is a broad term that is being used, as I can't define the site otherwise.
