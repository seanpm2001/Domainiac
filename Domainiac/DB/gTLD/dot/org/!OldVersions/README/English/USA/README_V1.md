## Controversies

### 2020 failed sale

**Excerpt from:** [`Wikipedia/wiki/.org`](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=.org&oldid=1146253602&useskin=monobook)

`In April 2019, ICANN proposed an end to the price cap of .org domains and effectively removed it in July in spite of having received 3,252 opposing comments and only six in favor. A few months later, the owner of the domain, the Public Interest Registry, proposed to sell the domain to investment firm Ethos Capital. After intense criticism from nonprofit groups and significant figures in Internet history, the proposal was scrapped.`
